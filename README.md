# ProteinDescriptor
a protein descriptor for site prediction

A four-channel grid protein descriptor is constructed based on ligsite, L-J potential, and Coulomb force, which can be used for protein binding site prediction.By using 16 X 16 X 16 sampling to classify and cluster the blocks, the binding sites of the proteins are finally determined. The detailed processing is shown in the figure blow.
